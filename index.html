# Samples, populations and sampling
----
- Sampling theory plays role in specifying the assumptions upon which your statistical inferences rely
-  We’re drawing inferences from (the sample) and what it is that we’re drawing inferences about (the population).
- We can’t possibly get every person in the world to do our experiment

**The Bayesian view**
- is often called the subjectivist view

Problem: how to operationalize “degree of belief”?

.content-box-blue[Example: If someone offers me a bet that if it rains tomorrow then I win $5, but if it doesn’t rain I lose $5. Clearly, from my perspective, this is a pretty good bet. On the other hand, if I think that the probability of rain is only 40% then it’s a bad bet to take. So we can operationalise the notion of a “subjective probability” in terms of what bets I’m willing to accept.
]

You don’t need to be limited to those events that are repeatable. The main disadvantage (to many people) is that we can’t be purely objective. Specifying a probability requires us to specify an entity that has the relevant degree of belief. This entity might be a human, an alien, a robot, or even a statistician. But there has to be an intelligent agent out there that believes in things. To many people this is uncomfortable, it seems to make probability arbitrary.

To answer the question above, we can randomly draw a sample from the population (_N_ = 100), and using the tools of **probability**, try to infer what we learn from the sample to the population. This is called **inferential statistics**.

# Statistics and probability
----
.content-box-blue[
Probability theory is “the doctrine of chances”. It’s a branch of mathematics that tells you how often different kinds of events will happen. Questions one may ask:]
- What are the chances of a fair coin coming up heads 10 times in a row?
	- if we know the coin is far - 50% chance a flip will result in “heads”
- If I roll a six sided dice twice, how likely is it that I’ll roll two sixes?
	- chance of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1 in 6
- probabilistic questions start with a `known model` of the world

---
# Statistics and probability, cont.

- Model: _P_(heads) = 0.5 
  - the probability of “heads” is 0.5.fn[1]

- In `probability theory`, the model is known but the data are not

- The notation that we sometimes use to say that a variable X is normally distributed is as follows:

`X ~ Normal(µ, σ)`

Illustration of what happens when you change the standard deviation of a normal distribution. Both distributions plotted in this figure have a mean of μ = 5, but they have different standard deviations. 
The solid line plots a distribution with standard deviation σ = 1, and the dashed line shows a distribution with standard deviation σ = 2. 

As a consequence, both distributions are “centred” on the same spot, but the dashed line is wider than the solid one.

The area under the curve tells you the probability that an observation falls within a particular range. The solid lines plot normal distributions with mean μ = 0 and standard deviation σ = 1. The shaded areas illustrate “areas under the curve” for two important cases. In panel a, we can see that there is a 68.3% chance that an observation will fall within one standard deviation of the mean. In panel b, we see that there is a 95.4% chance that an observation will fall within two standard deviations of the mean.

.content-box-blue[
Two more examples of the “area under the curve” idea. There is a 15.9% chance that an observation is one standard deviation below the mean or smaller (left panel), and a 34.1% chance that the observation is somewhere between one standard deviation below the mean and the mean (right panel). Notice that if you add these two numbers together you get 15.9% + 34.1% = 50%. For normally distributed data, there is a 50% chance that an observation falls below the mean. And of course that also implies that there is a 50% chance that it falls above the mean.

.pull-right[
.content-box-blue[
The t-distribution is a continuous distribution that looks very similar to a normal distribution. Note that the “tails” of the t-distribution are “heavier” (i.e., extend further outwards) than the tails of the normal distribution). 

That’s the important difference between the two. This distribution tends to arise in situations where you think that the data actually follow a normal distribution, but you don’t know the `mean` or `standard deviation`. 

We’ll run into this distribution again in chapter Comparing two means.

.content-box-blue[
The χ²-distribution is is typically used with Categorical data analysis.

The χ²-distribution turns up all over the place is that if you have a bunch of variables that are normally distributed, square their values and then add them up (a procedure referred to as taking a “sum of squares”), this sum has a χ²-distribution

.pull-right[
.content-box-blue[
The F-distribution looks a bit like a χ²-distribution, and it arises whenever you need to compare two χ²-distributions to one another. Remember that χ² turns out to be the key distribution when we’re taking a “sum of squares”? Well, what that means is if you want to compare two different “sums of squares”, you’re probably talking about something that has an F-distribution. 

Later in chapter Comparing several means (one-way ANOVA), we’ll run into the F-distribution.
